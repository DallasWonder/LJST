"I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldn't, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!",3,5.0,understand everyon love place wouldnt right mani choic cool creami gelato well unless unlucki visit bad day gelato spot gone steepli downhill husband order strawberrykiwi flavor chocol peanut butter agreed gelato tast grainy notic ice crystal worse flavor tast like came bottle fresh imo becom place seeandbeseen savor good gelato,50
"The drinks here are great, and the baked goods are even better. There is a nice ambience about the place, lots of nice furniture. I love how the baristas make the lattes and cappucino's beautiful. The owner, Jeff, is also a great guy who's around quite a bit. The only criticism that I have of it is that the place is small and if you're coming out on the weekends, you need to get there before 8:30 AM otherwise there will be no place to sit.",4,7.5,drink great bake good even better nice ambienc place lot nice furniture love barista make latt cappucino beautiful owner jeff also great guy who around quit bit critic place small your come weekend need get  otherwis place sit,38

The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).

"If Cowboy Ciao is the best restaurant in Scottsdale then Cafe Carumba has to be just about the worst. This place is terrible. I went here with my family, and not a single one of us enjoyed our meal. The ""handmade chips and salsa"" were clearly store bought, and each of our entrees were consistently, blah. Nothing new or intriguing about any of their dishes, and the food just wasn't all that great.

I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it.  Flavorful and not dry.   Also had the chips and salsa which I did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most Mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks.  Flan was unimpressive.  I think I will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to Carlsbad Tavern for the flan (theirs is my favorite).,3,5.0,look chile relleno place great job make way like it flavor dry also chip salsa think anyth special order unlik mexican place expect time serv drink flan unimpressive think go back chile relleno head street carlsbad tavern flan their favorite,40
